# Visualization Bibliotheque
Some visualizations or analysis that I'm allowed to share but I don't want to explain them as an entire project. Excepting for play story that is actually explained as an entire project xd.

# Other repositories
Those are repositories where I have done some projects but aren't relevant enough to put them in my portfolio.
